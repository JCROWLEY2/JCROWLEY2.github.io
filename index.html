     <h2>The Beginning</h2>
     
     <p><img src="/Images/Me.jpg"style="float:right;width:auto;height:100px;">After moving to Guam in 2016, I would constantly drive past the sign for the Padi Open Water Course at <a href="https://www.mdaguam.com/">MDA</a> for $200. This went on for close to 3 years before I finally took the dive, literally. I had some of the best instructors and friends from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cnc.divers.page/">CnC Divers</a> that made the whole experience a dream. They related everything in the course to be very relaxed and memorable. It wasn't long before not only was I diving on Christmas that year, but I was ready to see and do more under water. After approximately 20 dives with friends and co-workers, did my interest's peak to wanting to take pictures underwater. I am by no means a photographer on land, so this was going to put me at a disadvantage trying to learn the <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/the-exposure-triangle">Photography Triangle.</a> This essentially lead to my next addiction, I mean hobby.</p>	
			
			<h2>Next Steps</h2>
			<p><img src="/Images/First Camera.jpg"style="float:left;width:auto;height:100px;">I was diving with my buddies early on and they were taking photographs underwater with a small camera of all the fish and small creatures we were seeing. It wasn't long before I became obsessed with wanted to share what I am seeing underwater with all my friends and family. This is where my first camera setup was purchased (<a href="#">Camera Equipment</a>). I wanted to be the Pok√©mon &copy; trainer of underwater photography and catch them all! </p>
