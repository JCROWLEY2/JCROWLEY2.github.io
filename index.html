Diving Project Website for SCKANS CSCI434
Student: Joshua Crowley
Last Updated: 24 Oct
Description: This will be a website in which is built per the instructions of the textbook and the Course. I plan to build upon the idea centered around Scuba Diving and my love for it. I would like to add a photo gallery that has a ton of great photos that my wife and I have taken as we dive around Guam. I would like to add a scrolling slide show at the main page of my website, then have a separate link at the top or interactive menu with different options as we progress through the course.
24 Oct 21: TONS of changes have occurred. Image responsiveness was changed to better
suite the layout and loading for the page. I really like the sytle and flow of the website
thus far. See notes and comments on other pages. Previous code will be kept just in case
something needs to be reverted.
21 Oct 21: Moved the CSS to a seperate file. I failed at starting
a new page, but got it figured out for a really basic page that has
embeded video and all other requirements for week 4, hopefully..
11 Oct 21: Added some style and fixed HTML tag at the top. In line with the exercise 7.3, I attempted to change how my viewport works for images. No impact to layout in code. I would like to change the images to use a JS script in the coming weeks.

  <img src="Images/Start-800.jpg" alt="Wife and I touching 2 Shipwrecks" style="width:100%;height:100%">
   <p>After moving to Guam in 2016, I would constantly drive past the sign for the Padi Open Water Course at <a href="https://www.mdaguam.com/">MDA</a> for $200. This went on for close to 3 years before I finally took the dive, literally. It wasn't long before not only was I diving on Christmas that year, but I was ready to see and do more under water. After approximately 20 dives with friends and co-workers, I found how to take my hobby to the next level. I am by no means a photographer on land, so this was going to put me at a disadvantage trying to learn the <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/the-exposure-triangle">Photography Triangle.</a> This essentially lead to my next addiction, I mean hobby.</p>

      <p>I was diving with my buddies early on and they were taking photographs underwater with a small camera of all the fish and small creatures we were seeing. It wasn't long before I became obsessed with wanted to share what I am seeing underwater with all my friends and family.
