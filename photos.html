	 <h2>Where it Began 105ft Down</h2>
  <img src="Images/Start-800.jpg" alt="Wife and I touching 2 Shipwrecks" style="width:100%;height:100%">
   <p>After moving to Guam in 2016, I would constantly drive past the sign for the Padi Open Water Course at <a href="https://www.mdaguam.com/">MDA</a> for $200. This went on for close to 3 years before I finally took the dive, literally. It wasn't long before not only was I diving on Christmas that year, but I was ready to see and do more under water. After approximately 20 dives with friends and co-workers, I found how to take my hobby to the next level. I am by no means a photographer on land, so this was going to put me at a disadvantage trying to learn the <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/the-exposure-triangle">Photography Triangle.</a> This essentially lead to my next addiction, I mean hobby.</p>

      <h3>My Camera Setup</h3>
      <p>I was diving with my buddies early on and they were taking photographs underwater with a small camera of all the fish and small creatures we were seeing. It wasn't long before I became obsessed with wanted to share what I am seeing underwater with all my friends and family. This is where my first camera setup was purchased (<a href="#">Camera Equipment</a>). I wanted to be the Pok√©mon&trade; trainer of underwater photography and catch them all!</p>
